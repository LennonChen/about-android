Object
========================================

Object结构体定义如下所示:

path: dalvik/vm/oo/Object.h
```
/*
 * There are three types of objects:
 *  Class objects - an instance of java.lang.Class
 *  Array objects - an object created with a "new array" instruction
 *  Data objects - an object that is neither of the above
 *
 * We also define String objects.  At present they're equivalent to
 * DataObject, but that may change.  (Either way, they make some of the
 * code more obvious.)
 *
 * All objects have an Object header followed by type-specific data.
 */
struct Object {
    /* ptr to class object */
    ClassObject*    clazz;

    /*
     * A word containing either a "thin" lock or a "fat" monitor.  See
     * the comments in Sync.c for a description of its layout.
     */
    u4              lock;
};
